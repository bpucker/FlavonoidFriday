## Introduction ##
The flavonoid biosnythesis is one of the best studied specialized metabolism pathways in plants. Flavonoids are produced by almost all land plants, but specific branches of this pathway are not present in all species. Flavonol biosynthesis, flavone biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosnythesis, and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis are some branches of the flavonoid biosynthesis. Products of these branches have different functions and the enzymes might compete for substrate when branches are active at the same time. Therefore, the gene expression of all players in this pathway is tightly regulated by a number of transcription factors (see Transcriptional Regulation). Fig. 1 provides a simplified overview of the flavonoid biosynthesis [(Pucker et al., 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/9/1103/htm).

### Transcriptional Regulation ###
The sophisticated regulatory network of the flavonoid biosnythesis contains members of numerous transcription factor families. Among the important families are MYBs, bHLHs, WD40s, NACs, and WRKYs. Some MYBs, bHLHs, and WD40s form a complex which is called MBW.

### Mutual Exclusion of Anthocyanins and Betalains ###
While the flavonoid biosynthesis is present in (almost) all land plants, certain branches are not. One famemous example is the mutual exclusion of anthocyanins and betalains in the Caryophyllales. The yellow to red betalains are another pigment group which replaced anthocyanins in several families of the Caryophyllales. Both pigments have never reported together in the same tissue and the same species.


### Automatic annotation of the flavonoid biosynthesis ###
Do you have a new transcriptome and genome assembly of a plant species? If you are interested in studying the flavonoid biosynthesis, [KIPEs](https://github.com/bpucker/KIPEs) [(Pucker et al., 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/9/1103/htm) could be helpful. KIPEs produces an annotation of the flavonoid biosynthesis players based on knowledge about the flavonoid biosynthesis in other species. A table of the involved genes and phylogenetic trees of all players in the pathways can serve as basis to investigate the flavonoid biosynthesis in a new species.
