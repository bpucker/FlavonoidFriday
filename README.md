## Introduction ##
The flavonoid biosnythesis is one of the best studied specialized metabolism pathways in plants. Flavonoids are produced by almost all land plants, but specific branches of this pathway are not present in all species. Flavonol biosynthesis, flavone biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosnythesis, and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis are some branches of the flavonoid biosynthesis. Products of these branches have different functions and the enzymes might compete for substrate when branches are active at the same time. Therefore, the gene expression of all players in this pathway is tightly regulated by a number of transcription factors (see Transcriptional Regulation). Fig. 1 provides a simplified overview of the flavonoid biosynthesis [(Pucker et al., 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/9/1103/htm).
