## Introduction ##
The flavonoid biosnythesis is one of the best studied specialized metabolism pathways in plants. Flavonoids are produced by almost all land plants, but specific branches of this pathway are not present in all species. Flavonol biosynthesis, flavone biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosnythesis, and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis are some branches of the flavonoid biosynthesis. Products of these branches have different functions and the enzymes might compete for substrate when branches are active at the same time. Therefore, the gene expression of all players in this pathway is tightly regulated by a number of transcription factors (see Transcriptional Regulation). Fig. 1 provides a simplified overview of the flavonoid biosynthesis [(Pucker et al., 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/9/1103/htm).

### Transcriptional Regulation ###
The sophisticated regulatory network of the flavonoid biosnythesis contains members of numerous transcription factor families. Among the important families are MYBs, bHLHs, WD40s, NACs, and WRKYs. Some MYBs, bHLHs, and WD40s form a complex which is called MBW.

### Mutual Exclusion of Anthocyanins and Betalains ###
While the flavonoid biosynthesis is present in (almost) all land plants, certain branches are not. One famemous example is the mutual exclusion of anthocyanins and betalains in the Caryophyllales. The yellow to red betalains are tyrosine-derived pigment group which replaced anthocyanins in several families of the Caryophyllales. Both pigments have never reported together in the same tissue and the same species. Please see [Timoneda *et al*., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15980) for a recent review of the complex pigment evolution in the Caryophyllales.


### Automatic annotation of the flavonoid biosynthesis ###
Do you have a new transcriptome and genome assembly of a plant species? If you are interested in studying the flavonoid biosynthesis, [KIPEs](https://github.com/bpucker/KIPEs) [(Pucker et al., 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/9/1103/htm) could be helpful. KIPEs produces an annotation of the flavonoid biosynthesis players based on knowledge about the flavonoid biosynthesis in other species. A table of the involved genes and phylogenetic trees of all players in the pathways can serve as basis to investigate the flavonoid biosynthesis in a new species.

### (3) Anthocyanins are colourful pigments ###
> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1370283419763105793">TWEET</a>:_** Anthocyanins (Greek: 'blue flower') are pigments with pH-dependent colours ranging from red to blue. Their functions include attraction of animals for pollination & seed dispersal, but also protection against abiotic stressors. #FlavonoidFriday (details: https://bit.ly/3uEZz1F)

While anthocyanins are well known for their colour, it is likely that additional functions in stress response might be even more important (reviewed by Landi et al., 2015).

### (4) Proanthocyanidins are responsible for seed coat colouration ###
> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1372820142980272130">TWEET</a>:_** Proanthocyanidins (PA) are responsible for a dark appearance of seed coats. The biosynthesis of PAs is not completely understood and probably differs between species #FlavonoidFriday (details:https://bit.ly/38XTBjk)

<img alt="Proanthocyanidins (Tweet #4)" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EwyzS7hWYAI6zQZ?format=jpg&name=medium" width="30%" height="30%">
</a>

LAR and ANR are involved in the PA biosynthesis in many species. However, A. thaliana lacks LAR, but is still able to produce proanthocyanidins which provide a dark colouration to the seed coat. This indicates that there must be a PA biosynthesis pathway which does not require LAR.

Flavonoids are not just responsible for beautiful flower phenotypes. These molecules can also be beneficial for human health. Flavonoids in the human diet and the potential for biomedical/biotechnological applications in the future were recently reviewed by [Ahn-Jarvis et al.](https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox8070202). They discus the releveance of increasing the bioavailability of flavonoids through agricultural engineering and targeted food design. The anti-proliferative, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and estrogenic activities of flavonoids could be harnessed to support classical treatments. While flavonoids show promising effects in cellular studies, the applied concentrations are almost impossible to reach with conventional food products. Changing the food processing might be one option to enhance the bioavailability. However, the bioavailability of flavonoids also depends on host factors like age and gender. Further research is required to understand the relevance of the nutrition in complex diseases.


### (6) Colours of Anthocyanins ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1380415184741801984">TWEET</a>:_** Pelargonidin, cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin are among the most common precursors of anthocyanins. #FlavonoidFriday (details: https://bit.ly/3d3BA5v)

<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1380415184741801984">
<img alt="Colours of Anthocyanins (Tweet #6)" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EygvdJdWEAoTWyK?format=jpg&name=900x900" width="40%" height="40%">
</a>


Pelargonidin (Pg), cyanidin (Cy), peonidin (Pn), delphinidin (Dp), petunidin (Pt) and malvidin (Mv) are the six most common anthocyanidins ([Sun et al., 2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rcm.6209)). Anthocyanidins are unstable until sugar groups are attached. This modification step converts anthocyanidins (aglycones) into anthcyanins. Anthocyanins are contribute to a wide range of colours ranging from red to mangenta (cyanin), from orange to red (pelargonin), and from magenta to purple (delphinin) ([Ferreyra et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2012.00222)).


### (7) Replacement of Anthocyanins by Betalains ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1382951896089038849">TWEET</a>:_** While anthocyanins are present in most plant species, they are replaced by another group of pigments in some families of the Caryophyllales: betalains. #FlavonoidFriday
(src:https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15980)

</a>


Both pigments (anthocyanins and betalains) were never observed together in the same plant which resulted in the mutual exclusion theory. A molecular mechanism which could cause this mutual exclusion is not known yet. Betalains do not occur in plant species outside the Caryophyllales. The current knowledge about the evolution of the betalain biosynthesis was recently reviewed in [Timoneda et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15980).


### (8) Anthocyanins - more than just colourful ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1385473515101503489">TWEET</a>:_** Anthocyanins are not just colourful pigments, but have additional funtions: 1) metal-chelating agent 2) photoprotection & antioxidant 3) modulator of ROS signaling 4) delay of senescence #FlavonoidFriday (details: https://bit.ly/32Fvoup)

Anthocyanins are well known for the colouring of flowers and other plant tissue. However, the evolution of these pigments might not only be due to the colour. It is possible that additional functions provided evolutionary advantages. A publication by [Landi et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2015.05.012) describes some of these functions:
1) Anthocyanins can serve as metal-chelating agents.
2) Anthocyanins can have a photoprotective and antioxidant effect.
3) The ROS signaling can be modulated by anthocyanins.
4) It seems that anthocyanins can delay senescencs that is promoted by nutient deficiency.
The functions and possible also additional ones can contribute differently to the evolutionary value of anthocyanins in numerous land plant species.


### (9) Red leaf colour of _Perilla frutescens_ ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1388002675455782912">TWEET</a>:_** A relative increase of anthocyanin biosynthesis over flavonol biosynthesis seems to explain the leaf colour difference between the Perilla frutescens cultivars JIZI1 and JIZI2. #FlavonoidFriday (details: https://bit.ly/3eAA1ve)


<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1388002675455782912">
<img alt="Red leaf colour of _Perilla frutescens_ (Tweet #9)" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0MY1HHWQAgGKgN?format=png&name=900x900" width="30%" height="30%">
</a>


_Perilla frutescens_ is a Chinese plant with nutritional and medical use. Flavonoids are probably an important factor. The varieties JIZI1 and JIZI2 differ in the (relative) amount of accumulated flavonoids. The green vs. red leaf colour difference indicates that anthocyanins might be involved. Differential expression analysis revealed 15 enzymes involved in this pathway. [Jiang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73274-y) state that 109 flavones, 33 flavonols, 27 flavonoids, 22 anthocyanins, 20 flavanones, and 12 isoflavones differ in their concentration between both cultivars. A gene expression analysis of the flavonoid biosynthesis shows up-regulation of almost all steps except for CHI and FLS. This might suggest (1) a general up-regulation of the pathway and (2) that the flux is directed towards anthocyanins and away from flavonols.

However, several open questions remain:
1) Why are DFR and ANS not up-regulated on all parallel branches of the flavonoid biosynthesis?
2) Is UGT75C1 accepting flavonol derivates and not just anthocyanins?
3) Which sequences are the orthologs of well characterized transcriptional regulators like MYB75, TT8, and TTG1?
4) Is the transcriptome assembly available?



### (10) Decoration of anthocyanins differs between species ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1390562044575850497">TWEET</a>:_** Anthocyanins are modified by glycosyltransferases, methyltransferases, and acyltransferases. These modifications can stabilize anthocyanins and are responsible for the huge diversity. #FlavonoidFriday (details: https://bit.ly/2QZPGww)

</a>

[Tohge et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erx177) provide a great summary of the current knowledge about the diversity of the flavonoid decoration/modification steps. While the aglycon biosynthesis is well characterized and highly conserved between species, the modification appears to be more flexible. Generally, sugars can be added at the OH groups at the C3, C5, and C7 positions. Not just single sugars, but also sugar chains or trees can serve as decoration. A recently identified flavonol modifying enzyme is BGLU6 ([Ishihara et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erv546)) which shows differences between A. thaliana accessions i.e. within a species. Therefore, it is not surprising that these decoration pathways are different between plant species.



### (11) Repressors of the anthocyanin biosynthesis ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1393091204762402816">TWEET</a>:_** Repressors of the anthocyanin biosynthesis are regulated by (1) development, (2) environmental triggers, or (3) plant hormones. Proteins and small RNAs can play a role. #FlavonoidFriday (details:https://bit.ly/3w8cfhg)

#### Negative regulators of the anthocyanin biosynthesis ####

An excellent Tansley review by [LaFountain & Yuan (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17397) summarizes the current knowlege about negative regulators of the anthocyanin biosynthesis and gives perspective for future research. Anthocyanin repressors are generally activated by (1) developmental processes, (2) environmental factors, or (3) plant hormones. Most repressors destablize the MBW complex which would otherwise activate anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. While the first anthocyanin repressors were identified more than 20 years ago, most were discovered in the last decade. Activators of the anthocyanin biosynthesis belong to R2R3-MYB subgroup 6 or 5. In contrast, many repressors fall in subgroup 4.
1) There are active repressors in subgroup 4, which can be classified into FaMYB1-type and AtMYB4-type. It appears that an EAR motif is crucial for the repressor function. LaFountain & Yuan describe the function of the repressors as a "break" instead of an "off-switch". 
2) Another group of repressors lost one MYB repeat and is characterized by the presence of a 'TLLLFR' motif. There are indications for multiple different origins of these anthocyanin biosynthesis repressors.
3) The CPC-clade of repressors emerged in the common ancestor of monocots and dicots. Members of this clade lack the bHLH interaction motif which leads to passive represssion by competing for the bHLH component of the MBW complex. Expression of these MYBs is activated by the MBW complex which creates a periodic pattern of gene expression which becomes visible as spots or stripes of pigmentation.
4) miR156-SPL is highly expressed in seedlings and down-regulated a negative regulator (_SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 9_) of the anthocyanin biosynthesis. This explains a temporal pigmentation of seedlings called "juvenile reddening" which is lost in later stages.
5) miR858 targets the anthocanin activator MYB113 in A. thliana. miR828 targets the negative regulator _MYBL2_ in _A. thaliana_, but the positive regulator _MYB7-like_ in tomato.
6) GL2 in _A. thaliana_ is a HD-ZIP family member that down-regulates _PAP2_ and _MYB113_. HAT1 is another HD-ZIP member that represses anthocyanin biosynthesis. GL2 and HAT1 might be a lineage-specific specialty of _A. thaliana_. In contrast, HB1 (discovered in apple) might be a more conserved repressor of the HD-ZIP family.


### (12) MYB117 can boost the anthocyanin biosynthesis in poplar ###
