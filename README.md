## Introduction ##
The flavonoid biosnythesis is one of the best studied specialized metabolism pathways in plants. Flavonoids are produced by almost all land plants, but specific branches of this pathway are not present in all species. Flavonol biosynthesis, flavone biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosnythesis, and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis are some branches of the flavonoid biosynthesis. Products of these branches have different functions and the enzymes might compete for substrate when branches are active at the same time. Therefore, the gene expression of all players in this pathway is tightly regulated by a number of transcription factors (see Transcriptional Regulation). Fig. 1 provides a simplified overview of the flavonoid biosynthesis [(Pucker et al., 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/9/1103/htm).

### Transcriptional Regulation ###
The sophisticated regulatory network of the flavonoid biosnythesis contains members of numerous transcription factor families. Among the important families are MYBs, bHLHs, WD40s, NACs, and WRKYs. Some MYBs, bHLHs, and WD40s form a complex which is called MBW.

### Mutual Exclusion of Anthocyanins and Betalains ###
While the flavonoid biosynthesis is present in (almost) all land plants, certain branches are not. One famemous example is the mutual exclusion of anthocyanins and betalains in the Caryophyllales. The yellow to red betalains are tyrosine-derived pigment group which replaced anthocyanins in several families of the Caryophyllales. Both pigments have never reported together in the same tissue and the same species. Please see [Timoneda *et al*., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15980) for a recent review of the complex pigment evolution in the Caryophyllales.


### Automatic annotation of the flavonoid biosynthesis ###
Do you have a new transcriptome and genome assembly of a plant species? If you are interested in studying the flavonoid biosynthesis, [KIPEs](https://github.com/bpucker/KIPEs) [(Pucker et al., 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/9/1103/htm) could be helpful. KIPEs produces an annotation of the flavonoid biosynthesis players based on knowledge about the flavonoid biosynthesis in other species. A table of the involved genes and phylogenetic trees of all players in the pathways can serve as basis to investigate the flavonoid biosynthesis in a new species.



## Tweets with addtional background ##

### (1) General Flavonoid Biosynthesis Overview ###
> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1365194891475750916">TWEET</a>:_** Flavonoids are a large group of phenylalanine-derived specialized metabolites in plants. Branches of the biosynthesis lead to flavonols, anthocyanins, proanthocyanins, flavones, and others. #FlavonoidFriday (src: https://bit.ly/2NRPlKw)

The background about this tweet is described above in the general introduction to the flavonoid biosynthesis.


### (2) Flavonol biosynthesis is an old branch of the flavonoid biosynthesis ###
> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1367746709913145345">TWEET</a>:_** Flavonols are an evolutionary old group of flavonoids. Their functions include UV & ROS protection, but also signaling & regulation of developmental processes. Flavonol production is triggered by biotic and abiotic factors #FlavonoidFriday (src: https://bit.ly/3q5Ggei)


### (3) Anthocyanins are colourful pigments ###
> **_<a href="https://github.com/bpucker/FlavonoidFriday">TWEET</a>:_** Anthocyanins (Greek: 'blue flower') are pigments with pH-dependent colours ranging from red to blue. Their functions include attraction of animals for pollination & seed dispersal, but also protection against abiotic stressors. #FlavonoidFriday (details: https://bit.ly/3uEZz1F)

While anthocyanins are well known for their colour, it is likely that additional functions in stress response might be even more important (reviewed by Landi et al., 2015).

### (4) Proanthocyanidins are responsible for seed coat colouration ###
> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1372820142980272130">TWEET</a>:_** Proanthocyanidins (PA) are responsible for a dark appearance of seed coats. The biosynthesis of PAs is not completely understood and probably differs between species #FlavonoidFriday (details:https://bit.ly/38XTBjk)

LAR and ANR are involved in the PA biosynthesis in many species. However, A. thaliana lacks LAR, but is still able to produce proanthocyanidins which provide a dark colouration to the seed coat. This indicates that there must be a PA biosynthesis pathway which does not require LAR.

### (5) Dietary Flavonoids ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1375356855279570947">TWEET</a>:_** Flavonoids are abundant phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables. Health and nutritional benefits were reported for several flavonoids including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions #FlavonoidFriday (details:https://bit.ly/3w3hksj)


Flavonoids are not just responsible for beautiful flower phenotypes. These molecules can also be beneficial for human health. Flavonoids in the human diet and the potential for biomedical/biotechnological applications in the future were recently reviewed by [Ahn-Jarvis et al.](https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox8070202). They discus the releveance of increasing the bioavailability of flavonoids through agricultural engineering and targeted food design. The anti-proliferative, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and estrogenic activities of flavonoids could be harnessed to support classical treatments. While flavonoids show promising effects in cellular studies, the applied concentrations are almost impossible to reach with conventional food products. Changing the food processing might be one option to enhance the bioavailability. However, the bioavailability of flavonoids also depends on host factors like age and gender. Further research is required to understand the relevance of the nutrition in complex diseases.


### (6) Colours of Anthocyanins ###

> **_<a href="">TWEET</a>:_** Pelargonidin, cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin are among the most common precursors of anthocyanins. #FlavonoidFriday (details: https://bit.ly/3d3BA5v)


Pelargonidin (Pg), cyanidin (Cy), peonidin (Pn), delphinidin (Dp), petunidin (Pt) and malvidin (Mv) are the six most common anthocyanidins ([Sun et al., 2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rcm.6209)). Anthocyanidins are unstable until sugar groups are attached. This modification step converts anthocyanidins (aglycones) into anthcyanins. Anthocyanins are contribute to a wide range of colours ranging from red to mangenta (cyanin), from orange to red (pelargonin), and from magenta to purple (delphinin) ([Ferreyra et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2012.00222)).
